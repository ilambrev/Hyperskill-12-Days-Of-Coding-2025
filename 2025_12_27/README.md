# 2025.12.27 - On The Third Day Of Coding...

My solution -> *[2025_12_27_on_the_third_day_of_coding](2025_12_27_on_the_third_day_of_coding.py)*

## **_Task condition:_**

*_On the third day of coding my team lead sent to me... Three security rules,_*

*_Two pointers, and a nasty bug in a production tree!_*

Mr. Frost is quite sad today. The reindeer system got hacked. Apparently, Rudolph had `rednose` set as his password. Was not hard to break at all! The cybersecurity team developed a new system where each reindeer has to come up with 50 different passwords, out of which the tech team will choose the best one on a set of three rules.

Oh, and by "the tech team" they mean **you**. Good luck!

**Input**: list of 50 passwords chosen by reindeer, each on a new line

**Output**: A password with the highest security score based on three rules. In case of ties, the earlier password in the file takes precedence.

**The three rules**:

- Base password security score is its length.
- Every password should have at least: one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, one digit, one special symbol (`!@#$%^&*`). If any of these categories are missing, multiply base score by `0.75` for each missing category.
- Every password should minimize repeated characters. If at least `30%` of password consists of the same character, subtract the number of occurrences of that character from the score (applied only to the most frequent character).

**_NOTES:_**

- Data for this task is located in given file - *[hyperskill-dataset-119010469.txt](hyperskill-dataset-119010469.txt)*.
- You will need to submit only the right answer as plain text.
- You can write and run code in IDE of your choice.
