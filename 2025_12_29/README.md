# 2025.12.29 - On The Fifth Day Of Coding...

My solution -> *[2025_12_29_on_the_fifth_day_of_coding](2025_12_29_on_the_fifth_day_of_coding.py)*

## **_Task condition:_**

*_On the fifth day of coding my team lead sent to me... Five-pointed star,_*

*_Four dining elves, three security rules, two pointers, and a nasty bug in a production tree!_*

Mr. Frost walks in holding a sheet of graph paper covered in coordinate points. "We're decorating the office for the winter festival. I've been designing 5-pointed stars to hang from the ceiling, but I need to order the right amount of golden fabric to cover them. Each star is defined by 10 points - 5 outer points (the tips) and 5 inner points (where the edges meet). I need you to calculate the total area so I know how much material to buy."

He hands you a file with coordinates.

**Input format**: 10 lines, each containing a coordinate pair in format x,y (the points alternate between outer (tip) and inner points as you traverse the star's perimeter)

**Output**: The area of the star, rounded to 2 decimal places

**Hint**: *[this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoelace_formula)* might help you with a certain part of the task.
